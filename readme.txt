Allows the use of select ARIA attributes when creating content in WordPress.

## Description

Allows a select set of ARIA attributes to be used by content creators in TinyMCE and when saving post content.

* `aria-describedby`
* `aria-hidden`
* `aria-label`
* `aria-labelledby`

ARIA attributes will still need to be entered manually in the Text view, but they will not be stripped out when switching to Visual once this plugin is activated.
